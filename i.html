          <div>
            <p>We are a group of kinbaku enthusiasts focused on education for
              advancement of the art. We prioritize information based on
              primary source material and first-hand instruction. </p>

            <p>The group was started in 2012 in Los Angeles, CA, but we now
              have members and friends spanning the globe. </p>

            <p>As a group of friends who share common interests, we are an
              anarchist rope collective with no formal leaders.</p>

            <p>DMS has grown exponentially through our local class structure
              (the various <a href="/cell.html">Cells</a>) and public
              introductory classes. </p>

            <!-- <p>We also host visiting domestic and international 
              instructors. (Find some of them in our <a href="/links.html">
                Links</a> or see who's coming next on our <
                  a href="/calendar.html">Calendar</a>.) </p> -->
            
            <p>Our members attend and teach at national and international 
              conferences and various local rope groups. See what we're doing 
              locally and where we'll be next on our 
              <a href="/calendar.html">Calendar</a> or check out our list of 
              <a href="/class.html">Instructors</a> to discover who is 
              available to teach you.</p>

            <p>If you are not local to southern California but are interested 
              in our iterative teaching style, <a href="/cell.html#not-local">
                check out some other groups</a> who have adopted our methods and

					DMS Consent and Accountability
				</h2>
				<p>
          The Devil Mask Society prioritizes consent and accountantability. As 
          such we have developed the following documents to outline expectations
           at our events. This section will be updated as additional 
           accountability processes are put into action.
        </p>

					<li><a href="/coc.html">Code of Conduct</a> for Instructors / Hosts 
            and Students / Attendees at our events</li>
					<li><a href="/consent-statement.html">Consent Statement</a> to be read
             at our events</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
          For transparency and accountability, we have compiled an overview of 
          the racial and gender equity over the history of DMS and its Cell 
          program. We also outlined steps we could take to foster more diversity
           and inclusion going forward but are excited to hear additional 
           suggestions. Please read the 
           <a href="https://bit.ly/CellEquityHistory">DMS Equity overview</a>.

        <h2>What is a Cell?</h2>
				<p>Devil Mask Society instructs locally in what we refer to as Cells.
          These Cells consist of multiple tying pairs arranged in a cohort. The
          curriculum is iterative. The tying Cell seeks to explain individual
          component purposes. These components are then contextualized to allow
          students to create the aesthetic of their choice. The bottoming Cell,
          Cell X, builds on a foundation of strong communication and body
          awareness in a tying lab setting where those in rope explore
          preferences and current capabilities.

        <h2>What is a cohort?</h2>
				<p>A cohort is a group of students undergoing a curriculum together.
          Cohorts allow individual students the benefit of a larger support
          structure than a single instructor, or instructor and teaching
          assistant. Additionally, the cohort allows students to learn from each
          other. This grouping also creates a community of encouragement and
          group discovery that can assist different types of learning
          modalities.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What is the curriculum?</h2>
				<p>The Devil Mask Society tying Cell curriculum focuses on understanding
          components essential to patterns, contextualizing those patterns to
          express aesthetic, and mastering technique for effective communication
          between tying partners. These three focus areas are taught
          simultaneously, with each lesson building upon the previous. The end
          goal of the curriculum is to create a student who has the ability and
          context to continue to learn in whatever manner they see fit, from
          whomever they see fit, to express themselves in this medium. The tying
          curriculum currently spans 20 months with classes meeting formally
          once per month. </p>
				<br>
				<p>The Cell X bottoming curriculum focuses on building skills for rope
          vocabulary and communication, self-awareness and preferences in rope,
          and risk assessment and self-advocacy. These are tackled in a
          three-prong approach, with each lesson building upon those before it.
          The end goal of the curriculum is to create an informed, risk-aware
          student who can approach a new tying situation from a perspective of
          collaboration with their tying partner. The curriculum spans 12
          months, with classes meeting formally once per month. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How does tuition work?</h2>
				<p>Our local Cell structure is offered without charge. The expectations
          of tuition are:
					<ul>
						<li>Students will arrive promptly, prepared for class. (Not more 
              than 15 minutes early.)</li>
						<li>Students will respect the instructors and their fellow students
              during class.</li>
						<li>Students will attend all scheduled classes with no more than
              three absences (must notify instructors by email in advance).</li>
						<li>Students will be granted no more than three make up lessons
              during the 20-month class cycle.*</li>
						<li>Each lesson will be taught no more than one additional time as a
              make up. All students who have missed the regularly scheduled
              class will be expected to coordinate amongst themselves to
              schedule this single lesson with the instructors.*</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Students who are unable to meet the expectations of tuition will be
            asked to leave their cohort to ensure that other studentsâ€™ learning
            is not impacted.
          </p> 
						*Only applicable to the tying Cells. Due to the lab and discussion
            format of Cell X, no makeup lessons are provided.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How often do new Cells open?</h2>
				<p>Due to limited availability of the instructors and the 12- or
          20-month curriculum, new Cells are opened at most once per year - when
          the current Cell graduates or has decreased in size enough to open an 
          additional block of time.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Who are the instructors?</h2>
				<p>Current primary instructors of the tying Cell are Ojipan and
          goodmosttimes (both are cis-gendered switches of European descent).
					The primary instructors of Cell X, the bottoming curriculum, are
          goodmosttimes and ruminating who are both cis-gendered women of
          European descent. Our TAs hail from various ethnic backgrounds, range
          in age from mid-20s to mid-50s, and represent different sexual
          orientations and D/s identities. In both courses, we strive to foster
          an open and inclusive atmosphere where all feel welcome and respected
          and expect the same from our students.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Are there details about the classes and the space?</h2>
				<p>Cell classes are held monthly - tying cell classes are 2 hours and
          bottoming cell sessions are 3 hours each. They take place in a private
          residence in Downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately the unit is not ADA
          approved and the space limitations, as well as the physical nature of
          the course, would make attendence by those in wheelchairs
          inappropriate.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How does someone join a Cell?</h2>
				<p>Public applications are taken for each Cell, usually a few months
          before the cohort begins. After application, there is an interview
          process. This is to ensure that participants understand the learning
          commitment fully. After interviews are complete, invitations are
          extended to potential members of the new cohort and lessons begin. 9th
          Cell launched in November 2018 and 10th Cell began in September 2019. 
          Cell X1, the inagural bottoming cohort graduated in May 2019. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The 9th Cell will conclude in November 2021.</li>
          <li>10th Cell will run through August 2022.</li>
          <li><b><strong>Cell X is on hiatus until further notice.</strong></b></li>
        </ul>
