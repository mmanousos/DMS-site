            <h2 class="subheader">What is a Cell?</h2>
            <p>Devil Mask Society instructs locally in what we refer to as Cells. These Cells consist of multiple tying pairs arranged in a cohort. The curriculum is iterative, seeking to explain individual component purposes. These components are then contextualized to allow students to create the aesthetic of their choice. 
        </div>
        
        <div class="cell-info">
            <h2 class="subheader">What is a cohort?</h2>
            <p>A cohort is a group of students undergoing a curriculum together. Cohorts allow individual students the benefit of a larger support structure than a single instructor, or instructor and teaching assistant. Additionally, the cohort allows students to learn from each other. This grouping also creates a community of encouragement and group discovery that can assist different types of learning modalities.
        </div>
        
        <div class="cell-info">
            <h2 class="subheader">What is the curriculum?</h2>
            <p>The Devil Mask Society curriculum focuses on understanding components essential to patterns, contextualizing those patterns to express aesthetic, and mastering technique for effective communication between tying partners. These three focus areas are taught simultaneously, with each lesson building upon the previous. The end goal of the curriculum is to create a student who has the ability and context to continue to learn in whatever manner they see fit, from whomever they see fit, to express themselves in this medium. The curriculum currently spans 20 months, with classes meeting formally once per month.

        <div class="cell-info">
            <h2 class="subheader">How does tuition work?</h2>
            <p>Our local Cell structure is offered without charge. The expectations of tuition are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Students will arrive promptly, prepared for class.</li> 
                    <li>Students will respect the instructors and their fellow students during class.</li>
                    <li>Students will attend all scheduled classes with no more than three absences (must notify instructors by email in advance).</li>
                    <li>Students will be granted no more than three make up lessons during the 20-month class cycle.</li>
                    <li>Each lesson will be taught no more than one additional time as a make up. All students who have missed the regularly scheduled class will be expected to coordinate amongst themselves to schedule this single lesson with the instructors.</li> 
                </ul>
            <p>Students who are unable to meet the expectations of tuition will be asked to leave their cohort to ensure that other studentsâ€™ learning is not impacted.

        <div class="cell-info">
            <h2 class="subheader">How often do new Cells open?</h2>
            <p>Due to limited availability of the instructors and the 20-month curriculum new Cells are only opened once per year when the current Cell has decreased in size enough to open an additional block of time.
        </div>
        
        <div class="cell-info">
            <h2 class="subheader">Who are the instructors?</h2>
            <p>Current primary instructors of the Cells are Ojipan and goodmosttimes (both are cis-gendered switches of European descent). Our TAs hail from various ethnic backgrounds, range in age from mid-20s to mid-50s, and represent different sexual orientations and D/s identities. We strive to foster an open and inclusive atmosphere where all feel welcome and respected and expect the same from our students.
        </div>
        
        <div class="cell-info">
            <h2 class="subheader">How long is each class? Where are classes held? Who can access the space?</h2>
            <p>Classes are 2 hours each, held monthly. They take place in a private residence in Downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately the unit is not ADA approved and the space limitations, as well as the physical nature of the course, would make attendence by those in wheelchairs inappropriate.
        </div>
        
        <div class="cell-info">
            <h2 class="subheader">How does someone join a Cell?</h2>
            <p>Public applications are taken for each Cell, usually a few months before the cohort begins. After application, there is an interview process. This is to ensure that participants understand the learning commitment fully. After interviews are complete, invitations are extended to potential members of the new cohort and lessons begin. The two 2017 cohorts, 7th and 8th Cells, are currently active. Applications are also open for our new <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ci8GHe5ORLr1o0bWxs68bFumJoHuUn8xDyOjPzpj2Q0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Cell X program</a> - a rope bottoming curriculum. <a href="https://form.jotform.com/80066509588163" target="_blank">Apply now!</a> Applications close Sunday, April 8, 2018.
