          <h2>What is a Cell?</h2>
          <p>
            Devil Mask Society instructs locally in what we refer to as Cells.
            These Cells consist of multiple tying pairs arranged in a cohort.
            The curriculum is iterative. The tying Cell seeks to explain
            individual component purposes. These components are then
            contextualized to allow students to create the aesthetic of their
            choice. The bottoming Cell, Cell X, builds on a foundation of strong
            communication and body awareness in a tying lab setting where those
            in rope explore preferences and current capabilities.
          </p>

          <h2>What is a cohort?</h2>
          <p>
            A cohort is a group of students undergoing a curriculum together.
            Cohorts allow individual students the benefit of a larger support
            structure than a single instructor, or instructor and teaching
            assistant. Additionally, the cohort allows students to learn from
            each other. This grouping also creates a community of encouragement
            and group discovery that can assist different types of learning
            modalities.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What is the curriculum?</h2>
          <p>
            The Devil Mask Society tying Cell curriculum focuses on
            understanding components essential to patterns, contextualizing
            those patterns to express aesthetic, and mastering technique for
            effective communication between tying partners. These three focus
            areas are taught simultaneously, with each lesson building upon the
            previous. The end goal of the curriculum is to create a student who
            has the ability and context to continue to learn in whatever manner
            they see fit, from whomever they see fit, to express themselves in
            this medium. The tying curriculum currently spans 20 months with
            classes meeting formally once per month.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Cell X bottoming curriculum focuses on building skills for rope
            vocabulary and communication, self-awareness and preferences in
            rope, and risk assessment and self-advocacy. These are tackled in a
            three-prong approach, with each lesson building upon those before
            it. The end goal of the curriculum is to create an informed,
            risk-aware student who can approach a new tying situation from a
            perspective of collaboration with their tying partner. The
            curriculum spans 12 months, with classes meeting formally once per
            month.

          <h2>How does tuition work?</h2>
          <p>
            Our local Cell structure is offered without charge. The expectations
            of tuition are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Students will arrive promptly, prepared for class. (Not more than
              15 minutes early.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Students will respect the instructors and their fellow students
              during class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students will attend all scheduled classes with no more than three
              absences (must notify instructors by email in advance).
            </li>
            <li>
              Students will be granted no more than three make up lessons during
              the 20-month class cycle.*
            </li>
            <li>
              Each lesson will be taught no more than one additional time as a
              make up. All students who have missed the regularly scheduled
              class will be expected to coordinate amongst themselves to
              schedule this single lesson with the instructors.*
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Students who are unable to meet the expectations of tuition will be
            asked to leave their cohort to ensure that other students’ learning
            is not impacted.
          </p>
          *Only applicable to the tying Cells. Due to the lab and discussion
          format of Cell X, no makeup lessons are provided.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How often do new Cells open?</h2>
          <p>
            Due to limited availability of the instructors and the 12- or
            20-month curriculum, new Cells are opened at most once per year -
            when the current Cell graduates or has decreased in size enough to
            open an additional block of time.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Who are the instructors?</h2>
          <p>
            Current primary instructors of the tying Cell are Ojipan and
            goodmosttimes (both are cis-gendered switches of European descent).
            The primary instructors of Cell X, the bottoming curriculum, are
            goodmosttimes and ruminating who are both cis-gendered women of
            European descent. Our TAs hail from various ethnic backgrounds,
            range in age from mid-20s to mid-50s, and represent different sexual
            orientations and D/s identities. In both courses, we strive to
            foster an open and inclusive atmosphere where all feel welcome and
            respected and expect the same from our students.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Are there details about the classes and the space?</h2>
          <p>
            Cell classes are held monthly - tying cell classes are 2 hours and
            bottoming cell sessions are 3 hours each. They take place in a
            private residence in Downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately the unit is
            not ADA approved and the space limitations, as well as the physical
            nature of the course, would make attendence by those in wheelchairs
            inappropriate.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How does someone join a Cell?</h2>
          <p>
            Public applications are taken for each Cell, usually a few months
            before the cohort begins. After application, there is an interview
            process. This is to ensure that participants understand the learning
            commitment fully. After interviews are complete, invitations are
            extended to potential members of the new cohort and lessons begin.
