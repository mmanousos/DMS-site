          <p> <a href="https://fetlife.com/users/1657464" target="blank">Fuoco</a> is a bad-ass rope person.
            She has amazing flexibility and a dynamisim while bottoming in rope that is a delight to see.
            Day 1 she will lead exercises to get in touch with your body through stretching, somatics,
            body awareness drills, meditation, etc. Day 2 will cover more hands-on skills, including a
            workshop where we lab out poorly tied harnesses so that bottoms can learn to recognize and
            give feedback on things like tension, balance, structural integrity, etc.

          <p>Patterns in rope are beautiful and are the main things taught to beginners
            so they have a benchmark to show progress. But patterns can also be
            time-consuming and tedious to complete leaving both partners bored
            and frustrated. In this 80-minute class you’ll learn some tips and
            techniques for moving your rope fluidly and efficiently. Walk away
            with several new methods for practicing your new handling skills.

         <p> In rope education, we are often are taught a specific pattern,
           suspension order of operations or transition sequence. Then we focus
           on whether the final product is correct. But very little consideration
           is given to how we got there. In this two day workshop we will offer
           a vocabulary for the attendees to assess various aspects of their own
           suspensions including efficiency and rope handling, locking off
           uplines, body movement and ergonomics, and more. Tickets on sale now.

         <p> Rope has profound effects on those being tied and on riggers. In
           this daylong workshop, we will explore, from the perspective of
           neuroscience, how rope might affect us so strongly. Using
           neuroscience literature, live demos measuring brain activity during
           rope practices, analysis of brain data from excellent rope artists,
           hands-on exercises, and measuring attendees' brains, we will see
           how using insights from neuroscience can affect our rope topping
           and bottoming. <a href="https://fetlife.com/users/1803532"

             presented that work for ground play, partial, and full suspension.

            a bad-ass rope person. She has amazing flexibility and a dynamisim

            contortionist and aerialist with an in-depth understanding of the
            human body and a rope top which allows her to assess structures and
            positions from both sides of the tie offering a uniquely insightful
            perspective. Curriculum for this weekend is TBD but will likely
            involve building rope bottoming skills in suspension, flexibility,
            and body awareness, as well as assessing ties for sustainability.
