            <p>
              We are a group of kinbaku enthusiasts focused on education for
              advancement of the art. We prioritize information based on primary
              source material and first-hand instruction.
            </p>

            <p>
              The group was started in 2012 in Los Angeles, CA, but we now have
              members and friends spanning the globe.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a group of friends who share common interests, we are an
              anarchist rope collective with no formal leaders.
            </p>

            <p>
              DMS has grown exponentially through our local class structure (the
              various <a href="/cell.html">Cells</a>) and public events like the
              Devil Mask Society Rope Jam.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>We also host visiting domestic and international
						instructors. (Find some of them in our <a href="/links.html">
							Links</a> or see who's coming next on our <
								a href="/calendar.html">Calendar</a>.) </p> -->

            <p>
              Our members attend and teach at national and international
              conferences and various local rope groups. See what we're doing
              locally and where we'll be next on our
              <a href="/calendar.html">Calendar</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              In January 2024, three of our members - Ojipan, Ordinals, and
              goodmosttimes - launched Devil Mask Studio. This is a dedicated
              shibari studio in the heart of historic Downtown Los Angeles - a
              space for rope education and community. Learn more at
              <a

                >devilmaskstudio.com</a
              >.
            </p>

            <p>
              With the launch of the Studio and after 10 years of teaching the
              curriculum, Ojipan and goodmosttimes have decided to phase out the
              tying Cell program and replace it with the Studio Scholarship
              program (Scholarship program details forthcoming). 11th Cell is
              the final tying Cell cohort. All of the tying Cell program
              materials - including recordings from the 11th Cell livestreamed
              lessons - remain available online for free.
              <!-- Link to where Cell class materials are available -->
              The bottoming curriculum, Cell X, will continue to be offered
              periodically. Learn more about the
              <a href="/cell.html">Cell X program</a>.

        <p>
          The Devil Mask Society prioritizes consent and accountantability. As
          such we have developed the following documents to outline expectations
          at our events. This section will be updated as additional
          accountability processes are put into action.

        <p>
          For transparency and accountability, we have compiled an overview of
          the racial and gender equity over the history of DMS and its Cell
          program. We also outlined steps we could take to foster more diversity
          and inclusion going forward but are excited to hear additional
          suggestions. Please read the
