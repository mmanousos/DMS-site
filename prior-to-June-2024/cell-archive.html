          <h2>What is a Cell?</h2>
          <p>
            Devil Mask Society instructs locally in what we refer to as Cells.
            These Cells consist of multiple tying pairs arranged in a cohort.
            The curriculum is iterative. The tying Cell explained individual
            component purposes. These components are then contextualized to
            allow students to create the aesthetic of their choice.
          </p>

          <h2>What is a cohort?</h2>
          <p>
            A cohort is a group of students undergoing a curriculum together.
            Cohorts allow individual students the benefit of a larger support
            structure than a single instructor, or instructor and teaching
            assistant. Additionally, the cohort allows students to learn from
            each other. This grouping also creates a community of encouragement
            and group discovery that can assist different types of learning
            modalities.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What is the curriculum?</h2>
          <p>
            The Devil Mask Society tying Cell curriculum focuses on
            understanding components essential to patterns, contextualizing
            those patterns to express aesthetic, and mastering technique for
            effective communication between tying partners. These three focus
            areas are taught simultaneously, with each lesson building upon the
            previous. The end goal of the curriculum is to create a student with
            the ability and context to continue to learn in whatever manner they
            see fit, from whomever they see fit, to express themselves in this
            medium. The tying curriculum currently spans 20 months with classes
            meeting formally once per month.

          <h2>How did tuition work?</h2>
          <p>
            The Cell curriculum was offered without charge. The expectations of
            tuition were:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Students arrive promptly, prepared for class. (Not more than 15
              minutes early.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Students respect the instructors and their fellow students during
              class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students attend all scheduled classes with no more than three
              absences (must notify instructors by email in advance).
            </li>
            <li>
              Students were granted no more than three make up lessons during
              the 20-month class cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each lesson was taught no more than one additional time as a make
              up. All students who have missed the regularly scheduled class
              were expected to coordinate amongst themselves to schedule the
              lesson with the instructors.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Students unable to meet the expectations of tuition were asked to
            leave their cohort to minimize disruption to other students'
            learning.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>How often did new Cells open?</h2>
          <p>
            Due to limited availability of the instructors and the 20-month
            curriculum, new tying Cells were opened at most once per year - when
            the current Cell graduates or has decreased in size enough to open
            an additional block of time.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Who were the instructors?</h2>
          <p>
            The primary instructors of the tying Cell from 2014-2024 were Ojipan
            and goodmosttimes (both are cis-gendered switches of European
            descent). TAs hailed from various ethnic backgrounds, ranging in age
            from mid-20s to mid-50s, and representing different sexual
            orientations and D/s identities. We worked to foster an open and
            inclusive atmosphere where all felt welcome and respected and
            expected the same from our students.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Are there details about the classes and the space?</h2>
          <p>
            Tying Cell classes were held monthly for 2 hours in a private
            residence in Downtown Los Angeles. For more detail, read our
            comprehensive

        <section>
          <h2>How did someone join a Cell?</h2>
          <p>
            Public applications were taken for each Cell several weeks before
            the cohort began. After application, there was an interview process.
            This was to ensure that participants understood the learning
            commitment fully. Once interviews concluded, invitations were
            extended to potential members of the new cohort and lessons began.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id="not-local">Now what?</h2>
          <p>
            In 2024, after 10 years of teaching this curriculum, Ojipan and
            goodmosttimes phased out the tying Cell program from their local
            instruction. As always, the documentation for the curriculum remains
            freely available.
            <!-- click here for the  Google Drive with all of the teaching materials. -->
            Please use and adapt it to your own needs. We only ask that you
            attribute us where appropriate and please do not use the Devil Mask
            Society or Cell names to refer to your own program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the entirety of the 11th Cell cohort classes were
            broadcast and the recordings are available on the Devil Mask Society

          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond that, we are honored that other local rope instructors
            adopted and adapted our teaching methodologies in their own areas.
            We hope you can locate one close to you.
