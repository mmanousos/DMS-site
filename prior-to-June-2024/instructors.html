          <p>
            &ntilde;yaDom became fascinated with rope and knots as a Boy Scout.
            This propelled his desire to learn Kinbaku.... that and... well you
            know! ;) <br />
            He joined DMS as a student in the 4th Cell cohort, graduating in
            2016. He has since given back to the community as a TA for the
            subsequent DMS cohorts and co-host for the DMS monthly rope Social
            and Introductory Classes. He is presently hosting those two monthly
            events. He has also co-hosted the rope taster booths at Threshold
            Clubhouse in Los Angeles. He has continued his rope education by
            attending local weekend intensives with Nawashi Kanna, Pedro, Wykd
            Dave, Osada Steve, Kazami Ranki, Otonawa and others. 2018 saw him
            journey outside the LA rope scene attending Bondage Expo Dallas and
            Folsom Street Fair.

            a teaching team of switches, they specialize in addressing topics
            from both sides of a tie. Classes generally fall in the beginner to
            intermediate skill level range. They tailor the curriculum to the
            specifications of the host. They have travelled to teach intensives

            is a graduate of Devil Mask Society’s 6th Cell Cohort where she
            proudly earned the nickname, “Adult Panda.” She first entered the
            fetish scene in the mid-90’s when she frequented goth and industrial
            dance clubs and spent most of her time (and money) going to Brit-pop
            concerts. She began dabbling in rope in mid-2014, and strives to
            continually improve. She is a graduate of National Holistic
            Institute Los Angeles, and often incorporates her anatomy and
            massage training into her ropework. Although she is an avid rope
            enthusiast, she's a busy & multidimensional girl with many interests
            that she never has enough hours in the day to explore.
