          <h2>What is a Cell?</h2>
          <p>
            Devil Mask Society instructs locally in what we refer to as Cells.
            These Cells consist of multiple tying pairs arranged in a cohort.
            The curriculum is iterative. The bottoming Cell, Cell X, builds on a
            foundation of strong communication and body awareness in a tying lab
            setting where those in rope explore preferences and current
            capabilities.
          </p>

          <h2>What is a cohort?</h2>
          <p>
            A cohort is a group of students undergoing a curriculum together.
            Cohorts allow individual students the benefit of a larger support
            structure than a single instructor, or instructor and teaching
            assistant. Additionally, the cohort allows students to learn from
            each other. This grouping also creates a community of encouragement
            and group discovery that can assist different types of learning
            modalities.

          <h2>What is the Cell X curriculum?</h2>
          <p>
            Cell X is the Devil Mask Society curriculum for those wishing to
            enhance their skills for being in rope. It focuses on building rope
            vocabulary and communication, self-awareness and preferences in
            rope, and risk assessment and self-advocacy. These are tackled in a
            three-prong approach, with each lesson building upon those before
            it. The end goal of the curriculum is to create an informed,
            risk-aware student who can approach a new tying situation from a
            perspective of collaboration with their tying partner. The
            curriculum spans 12 months, with classes meeting formally once per
            month for three hours. Classes are a combination of lecture, lab
            time and discussion.

          <h2>How does tuition work?</h2>
          <p>
            Our local Cell structure is offered without charge. The expectations
            of tuition are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Students arrive promptly, prepared for class. (Not more than 15
              minutes early.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Students respect the instructors and their fellow students during
              class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Students attend all scheduled classes with no more than three
              absences (must notify instructors by email in advance). Due to the
              lab and discussion format of Cell X, no makeup lessons are
              provided.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Students who are unable to meet the expectations of tuition will be
            asked to leave their cohort to minimize the impact on other
            students' learning.

          <h2>How often do new Cells open?</h2>
          <p>
            Due to limited availability of the instructors and the 12-month
            curriculum, new Cells are opened at most once per year after the
            current Cell graduates.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Who are the instructors?</h2>
          <p>
            The primary instructors of Cell X are goodmosttimes - a cis-gendered
            woman - and Ordinals - a trans nonbinary individual. Both of them
            are of European descent. Our TAs hail from various ethnic
            backgrounds, range in age from mid-20s to mid-50s, and represent
            different sexual orientations and D/s identities. In both courses,
            we strive to foster an open and inclusive atmosphere where all feel
            welcome and respected and expect the same from our students.

          <h2>How does someone join a Cell?</h2>
          <p>
            Public applications are taken for each Cell several weeks before the
            cohort begins. After application, there is an interview process.
            This is to ensure that participants understand the learning
            commitment fully. Once interviews are complete, invitations are
            extended to potential members of the new cohort and lessons begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cell X2 cohort graduated in June 2024. The date has not yet been
            set for Cell X3. It will be publicly announced on our various
            channels when the date is set.

          <h2>What about those wanting to tie?</h2>
          <p>
            The tying Cell curriculm was phased out in 2024. All of the
            curriculum resources remain available for free. You can find all of
            the details on our Cell Archive page.
