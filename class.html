					<h4>ALTBRONTE</h4>
					<p>
						AltBronte has been doing rope in some fashion since 2012. She tops, bottoms, and self-suspends, and is happy to talk or teach about any of those subjects. Her style is semi-sadistic, playful, and constantly evolving. She offers classes about
						non-TK chest harnesses, tying as a smaller top, rope handling for short people, self-suspension, and intermediate bondage for sex, and is always developing new things to teach.

					<h4>BADLITTLEDOE</h4>
					<p>
						badlittledoe has been participating in the kink community since 2011. Having served as both a sub and Dom, his insight on both perspectives helps provide new approaches to the conversation between a top and a bottom. He’s a graduate of Devil
						Mask Society’s 6th Cell, a 20 month shibari course. Seeing a void in the rope community in their area of Long Beach, CA, he and rhapsodic launched <a href="http://tie.haus/" target='_blank'>TIEHAUS</a> - a place for foundational rope
						instruction with an emphasis on safety, negotiation, and consent. While he enjoys practicing shibari as an art form, he is meticulous about anatomy and its impact on rope play. He practices regularly, testing out ideas he finds online while musing his own concepts.

						Angeles, and often incorporates her anatomy and massage training into her ropework. Although she is an avid rope enthusiast, she's a busy & multidimensional girl with many interests that she never has enough hours in the day to explore. 						<a href="https://www.instagram.com/paperd0ll78/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/instagram.png" alt="instagram" />
